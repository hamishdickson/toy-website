        <p>Hello and welcome to Snowbear.co!</p>
        <p>Who are we? Well, simply put we are a tiny London based software house specialising in bespoke software.</p>
        <p>At the moment we are furiously bashing out 1's and 0's to build our new website, if you'd like to keep up to date, please check out our twitter feed or check out our updates here!</p>

        <p>Well, after a long weekend of coding, I've made some significant updates to the website - I've added a new <a href="labs">labs link</a> allowing everyone to see what we're working on. The plan is to keep this fully up to date, from here you will be able to see new products developing :) <span class="update">mish, 01/12/2013</span></p>
        <p>Hi! Welcome! This is my first post (and hopefully not my last!) about the creation of this site. As you can see, there is a lot of work to do and we have some grand plans - so please come back in the next week or so and see the progress we are making! <span class="update">mish, 25/11/2013</span></p>

                  My name is Hamish (or just mish for short) and I guess this is my company! I'm a very passionate software developer based in central London. During the day I work on financial software for investment banks. I like carrot cake, long walks on the beach and ... oh wait, you don't want to know about that :\ Check out the <a href="about">about tab</a> for some more information on me and the amazing people that have helped me get this far!
