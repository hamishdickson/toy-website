        <p>Hello and welcome to Snowbear.co!</p>
        <p>We are a tiny London based software house specialising in bespoke software.</p>
        <p>At the moment all our energy is going into building our new website and building the business up.</p>

          <p>Forming a company. It's taken me a while (like ... a year) to get round  to it, but Snowbear Software Limited is now a registered company! Wahoo! This is all part of being ready to trade from April (the launch date I'm aiming for). In other news, work continues to be very busy, so work for Snowbear has been pretty slow ... however ... I do have the beginnings of a logo on the go ... more to come ...<span class="update">mish, 29/12/2013</span></p>

          <p>Part 1: The great focus debate...</p> 
          <p>So, first thing's first. I'm sorry for not updating you for a while, but I've been a busy man! Let me fill you in - I spend my days working for a financial software company in the city. Much of what I'm working on at the moment is producing the programs to make valuations and statements for the very very wealthy. I've been doing this a while and have found the tools we use good ... but not exactly what we need, so along with someone else we've been looking to write our own PDF generation tools. This is a massive piece of work ... and we are doing it in our free time ... which hasn't left much time for this.</p>
          <p>Part 2: My frustration with Windows and desire to find something better</p>
          <p>So far, this website has been written in Windows ... which sounds better than it is. You see, most of the hardcore geeks out there use a unix based operating system - Mac OS, Chrome or Linux - which means the best software is available there first (and it's maintained better there). That's causing me some problems and I'm going to have to move to another OS ... probably Ubuntu.<span class="update">mish, 22/12/2013</span></p>

          <p>Well, after a long weekend of coding, I've made some significant updates to the website - I've added a new <a href="labs">labs link</a> allowing everyone to see what we're working on. The plan is to keep this fully up to date, from here you will be able to see new products developing :) <span class="update">mish, 01/12/2013</span></p>

          <p>Hi! Welcome! This is my first post (and hopefully not my last!) about the creation of this site. As you can see, there is a lot of work to do and we have some grand plans - so please come back in the next week or so and see the progress we are making! <span class="update">mish, 25/11/2013</span></p>

                I'm looking to launch Snowbear.co in April/May or 2014 and I would prefer to wait until then before I take on work, but if for some reason that's too late then feel free to get in touch and we can talk about it in more detail.

                  My name is Hamish (or just mish for short) and I guess this is my company! I'm a very passionate software developer based in central London. During the day I work on financial software for investment banks. I like carrot cake, long walks on the beach and ... oh wait, you don't want to know about that :\ Check out the <a href="about">about tab</a> for some more information on me and the amazing people that have helped me get this far!
